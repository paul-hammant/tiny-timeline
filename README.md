Start of a minimal timeline tech - showing 
events in order and allowing browser-phone 
interaction to see more.

Examples:

Women's rights: https://paul-hammant.github.io/tiny-timeline//tiny-timeline.html#womens-rights

Spaceflight Milestones: https://paul-hammant.github.io/tiny-timeline//tiny-timeline.html#spaceflight-milestones

Lots to do.
